# Machine-Learning-with-python

Machine Learning-->Teaching a Computer to do a particular task 
model ->Translate a data to learn 
Steps:
1.Gatherring data
2.Preparing data
3.Choosing a model
4.Training
5.Evaluation
6.Hyperparameter tuning
7.Prediction


Supervised Learning:
Task giving the ML to do to Supervise the Task
Labeling-->1.Training a model ,2.Test set 
            1.1 Machine Learner, 2.1 prediction Model--> Stats


Regression:
regression is a method of modelling a target based on independent pridictors
its a statistical tool which is user to find out the relation ship between the outcome variable also known as the dependednt variable and one or more variable often called as independent variable

Ex: Predicting the future price of a house



Classification:
its the Process of taking various Labels to train the algorithm to identify items within a specific category 
Ex: Handwritten Digit identification


Unsupervised Learning:
Clustering:
it means bundling the input variables with the same characteristics together 

Association:
Here we discover the rules that govern meaningful associations among the data set
